They didn't even put shots of coffee in one drink I ordered, and didn't put cream in the other. When asked to fix they argued that there was nothing wrong. The female is eating food behind the counter. One employee is not even in uniform or weari BFF a name tag. Touching everything like it's toys where is the manager?! Do you not expect food safety standards? Coffee was also cold after being ordered extra hot. Employee put hand in trash pulled out trash to fiddle with then touched products. Disgusting.\",\n",

Customers are left to 'bus' their select seats and table. Worse, the bathrooms are routinely out of paper goods: no toilet paper, no toilet seat covers, no paper (hand) towels.\\n\\nSo, an averaged three stars: 5 stars for the coffees and teas, etc, 1 star for the cleanliness.\",\n",
