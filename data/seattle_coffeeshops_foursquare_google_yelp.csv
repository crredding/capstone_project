This is often a place to relax during the day when it is slower, taking advantage of it's beautiful furnishings and regularly updated art galleries. It gets busier in the evening and is an excellent place for a meeting. I find that when recommending it people often have a hard time even finding it, a minor gripe. The business is a charity with donation based pricing or two free items a day for those that can't afford to go to a coffee shop; a tremendous and certainly unique effort on the part of the kind individuals that own this place to bring dignity and extra morale to the local homeless population. They also have a daycare center so it is a very diverse crowd that patrons this place. Highly recommended and please donate! "", 'This coffee shop is in a great location with a large inviting space.

Residents are friendly and will say hello.', 'A nice luxury place to retire', 'I am posting this on behalf of myself and my wife, Adriana, who wrote this review:\n\nAljoya has been a wonderfully warm and welcoming community for not only my mother, who suffers from dementia and even at the beginning of her residency could not remember people‚Äôs names and how to get from one place to another, but also for us, her family.\n \nAs an only child I was concerned about my mother continuing to live by herself. I knew that, although I was with her frequently and doing things with her, I could not possibly give her the care and activities I knew she would need. Mom and I had visited other retirement communities and mom was very adamant that she did not like their environments or d√©cor. For my own part, I wasn\'t very encouraged about either what we\'d seen or by my mother\'s reaction.\n\nOne day, after our weekly routine of shopping at Northgate, mom suggested we visit Aljoya. We made an appointment and the moment we walked in mom smiled, breathed in the aroma of the espresso in the Bistro and said ‚ÄúThis is it!‚Äù She was of course very impressed by the elegance in the d√©cor and the bright warm colors. (She often complained that most of the other facilities were depressing in colors etc.) \nWhat impressed me the most were the employees. To this day, 2 ¬Ω years later, the employees are the most amazing group of people of all ages who always have a smile, who greet everyone by name and enthusiastically always try to do something  to help residents and visiting family members. \n\nThe Wellness center, headed by Annie Atienza R.N., who is our number one ‚ÄúAngel,‚Äù as my mother calls her, and all of her staff have become an extension of our family.  They monitor mother daily and all of her vitals and are sure not only to watch over medical needs but also her psychological and emotional needs. \n\nIt is clear that Eli and Rebecca Almo and their amazing son, Jacob, have approached the creation of their facility as though they were creating a home for one of their own family members. They have not overlooked a single detail, from the outstanding staff that they hire and train to the smallest details of fresh flowers on the dining room tables to bowls of fresh fruit available to the residents as they wander throughout the complex. \n\nThe Almos are an extremely caring family, who are concerned about their residents from the day they walk in to the days that follow as some residents become more frail or ill. They have been a huge and very responsive support system to my family. I truly do not know what I would do or where I would have been able to turn in these recent months as my mother has continued to decline.  \n\nAt Aljoya the Almos have created a positive caring community. From those who work there to the other residents who live there, Aljoya has provided a welcoming neighborhood that surrounds my mother with life, love and caring. In many respects, giving up living ""on her own"" in her later years has been a gain and a blessing, not an ever increasing struggle. It has in fact brought her new comforts, new security and a new environment of great beauty.\n\nBecause of Aljoya, the staff and the Almos my mother will be able to live her last days in a warm and friendly atmosphere with exceptional nursing care and surrounded by her own personal possessions and family by her side.  We can‚Äôt thank everyone enough for all that they do every day and what they have done these past 2 ¬Ω years. \n', '', '']",,[]

Peering in the windows from time to time on the way home, this coffee shop had sparked my interest as nearly all of the tables were filled. It always looked lively and friendly. \n\nThe first night I went in, I had caught a lull in customers at the time. Everyone had already been seated with their orders. I ordered my drink and a sandwich after some careful consideration. The staff was so-so. They weren\'t friendly, but not horrible either. I sat down with my hot drink and waited for my sandwich to be warmed up. After 15 minutes and one customer after me, I finally asked about my hot sandwich I had ordered. ""Oh. Sorry."" Then I was handed a cold sandwich. \n\nSitting from my table, I watched as business started to pick up. I wasn\'t the only one who had ordered something that was forgotten, especially a food item. Those people were also handed cold food after waiting for their order, a few drinks were missed all together. The staff would apologize, but it was lackluster. I\'ve been there. Being a barista is harder than it looks and calls for lots of multitasking. It comes down to this: We\'re all human and things get missed, but putting some sincerity into apologies can go a long way. \n\nMy following two visits were more of the same. The drinks were eh. . . and the staff were eh. For me, this is part of the coffee shop experience and it just wasn\'t there. Genuine interaction with patrons and engaging with them even if its simply asking how their day was is a huge way to connect with people.\n\nI can note that Victrola coffee seems to be a popular place for meetups and gatherings. In my time visiting, most of the tables were full of people. This coffee shop does seem to attract a community of friends and family, despite the disconnect with the staff.
