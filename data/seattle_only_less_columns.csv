seattle rain and chocolate this is where it all began get a cup of coffee and wander around the market across the street youll come here to see the first starbucks but youll stay and come back for the street performers right out front  the switch ever hour and are some of the top talent ive seen starbucks opened its first store in 1971 in the pike place market in downtown seattle  because the market is a historic district with design guidelines the store retains its original look come late in the day when most of the market is shutting down or you will be swallowed in tourists this store is open till 9pm you can get exclusive souvenirs here you cant get at other starbucks this is the first starbucks ever amazing they still use nonautomatic machines and the baristas are so funny enjoy the place taste a real starbucks coffee there is always line only if you plan to purchase their original merchandise cups you can line dont wait only for a cup of coffee there are plenty of starbucks local coffee shops around the original starbucks getting espresso ask for a double ristretto shot in a ceramic cup they have them if you ask ‚Äî consume onsite only for the best italiancentric experience the cubano shot really does make all the difference if you like sweeter if your a starbucks fan you have to go here at least once if you cant handle a line well more original for us if you like to drink coffee have a very peaceful time with a great view to the puget sound this is your starbucks location great service same starbucks prices but there is not parking lot if i had more room in my carry on luggage i would have stock up on these souvenir mugs coz they make good holiday gifts the you are here mug is only 995 i believe üëç interesting to check it out but seriously packed with tourists so try to find the down time if there any the coffee base is different from the one used at starbucks usually worth tasting the line might look a bit intimidating but its pretty well organized inside as a coffee girl this is it once you make the pilgrimage you have to get the coffee hours this place is open until 9pm  usually in summers it used to be open till 9pm but they changed it recently and it will be open till 9pm through out the year a trip to seattle is not complete without a stop at starbucks store 1 this store definitely marches to its own beat many things are unique to this store and its definitely worth checking out from indianapolis to sf to the og starbucks in seattle  the dawn will always be a double tall nonfat no whip mocha they cant stir it here so ask for it swirled this starbucks is full of tourists so the line is usually long for coffee lovers though the line will be worth the wait there are also street musicians to help pass the time visiting here

avoid the lines and go somewhere else good luck  frappuccino dadam hahaha seattle t√° linds kahve iÃá√ßmek first one long line how lovely jorgecantu yeah not so much turists after 7pm break sejenak primer starbucks caf√© de la reserva especial s√≥lo se vende en esta la primera tienda starbucks dddddddddddd wouldnt mind a cup of starbucks later this afternoonevening hi ummmmmm slowest baristas ever ate they trying to keep tourists here longer so they buy more swag nyeeehh just test purely a tourist trap there is nothing spectacular here even the souvenirs are a letdown  if you really want the authentic seattle coffee experience try victrola in cap hill i‚Äôm normally not the biggest fan of hot coffee as i usually go with the ice option but i ventured out and tried the pikes place roast as it is unique to this location it was extremely tasty the line for ordering coffee stretched out the door but they had an associate just inside directing traffic and answering any questions that customers had overall the coffee was worth the wait and it was a neat experience for something that has become so mainstream another great starbucks location i enjoy the baristas young friendly and super helpful if you prefer a less strong cup of coffee order an ed half coffee hot water this was quite the experience  i took the opportunity to wonder in stop take a moment and inhale all the aromas that a typical coffee shop has to offer and enjoy the unique memorabilia that this store offers  a barista was out stocking up merchandise and took time to answer my questions as well as explain to me what makes the store unique  she also provided me with recommendations on the coffees that one can only get there  i must say that giving in is not so much of a bad thing when youre just standing there being vulnerable it was cool to visit the 1st starbucks even if i am not a coffee drinker  the area is trendy and the market across the street is very interesting  well with a trip to the area to check it all out how can you rate this less than 5 stars this is the original starbucks complete with the old logo and everything there is always a long line i actually left the first time saying to myself that ill come back i did same line but in true starbucks fashion the long moved along swiftly this is a must visit i believe that the 1st  pike starbucks is one of the most famous tourists sites in seattle and coffee is something extra there i went there at 530 pm on i visited seattle for the first time and like most tourists i wanted to visit the first starbucks location when i got there there was a huge line of first off this is not the first starbucks the first one burned down but the emblem from the first store is placed at this store   the line is super long,4436,1912

amount of people that were inside the food was delivered quickly and it was just as delicious as it was picturesque the only thing i would change is me being able to physically eat more so i could‚Äôve enjoyed some of their other options had breakfast here it was a very small place to eat but it was so worth it i can see this place getting even busier during the summer due to the warmer weather and patio space but for breakfast they had amazing hot chocolate and a wonderful staff my wife and i had breakfast at bacco cafe on december 29 and if not for our waiter mica we would have left except for mica the staff were incredibly rude maybe they didn‚Äôt like the fact that my wife is hispanic and i am white we really don‚Äôt know but the white couples seated on either side of us that arrived after we were seated were served before us and the staff walked by us like we didn‚Äôt exist until mica stepped in and came to our assistance thank you for your kindness mica and for taking a bit of the sting out of an uncomfortable situation   we love seattle it is an amazing place and most of the people we met were absolutely terrific too bad the same cannot be said about the bacco cafe really nice breakfast my wife got the dungeness crab benedict with irish coffee and i got the salmon hash with mocha cappuccino it was all really good and fresh no fishy taste for either dish we went sunday and even though main restaurant area was busy they have more indoor overflow seating around the corner  so stop in and ask for wait times you might get seated quicker than you think this place is great if you want to construct your food and pay a pretty penny the staff is amazing this is not a knock on them the food sucked 100 percent of the credit goes to my wife for finding this one for us  on our last night in seattle we were looking for something early and quite casual expect a long wait during the peak dinner hours as the restaurant is small the food is tasty but fails to exceed our expectations as weve had better this is a sweet holeinthewall joint that cooks and serves like a place three times its size  top notch chefs creative menus and friendly servers

order an italiano in a forhere cup its a fantastic way to learn to appreciate the subtitles and complexities of espresso good coffee laid back small town atmosphere everyone is friendly and as someone said earlier these guys know their coffee popular neighborhood spot where you can bring your computer for hours go there after dinner for tea and dessert  the coffee is fantastic but order the zoka way blend tea for a caffeine free option nonplussed by the vibe it could have been that i was just cranky and uncaffienated when i arrived but i wont go out of my way to go here again ya  that zoka bar was good  also wouldnt want anyone else besides these guys giving me coffee recommendations  they are the wine snobs of coffee love the abundance of outlets to plug into huge and busy also very nicely designed two words clover machines but youll never find a seat its like study hall for university of washington students in here this studious bunch gets prop for not succumbing to luaus noon happy hour the drip was hot  delicious they close at 1000pm not midnight  their website and yelp both say midnight but just hasnt been updated  i think sunday is even earlier friendly baristas that know their coffee the last two times ive been here the line had been so long and slow that i ended up leaving after waiting to order for 510 mins to go to grab coffee from mighty o across the street no clover machines  somehow the highest rated tip is totally false  coffee is excellent here however  no denying that one of the best sweet chais in seattle good decision zoka brings back their great scones vibe of this location is cool but the service is slow and coffee feels like it should be better than it is jam dot was a great match with americano great lattes and cappuccino try their organic whole beans this is a really great place to chill and work for a little while be careful on sat mornings there is a group of runners that meet here after their run and practically fill the place try cozy latte it is not on the menu but their best coffee the zoka bars are amazing but youll only need a bite or two to be satisfied they steam milk exceptionally well here they changed their closing time to 9pm aztec latte spicy i miss the couch awesome study spot with decent coffee comfy couch great teas the jam dots are fantastic and almost seem healthy love the coconut cream pie good coffee evil 2 hour wifi policy slow baristas i love this place it has great coffee and pastries and its wonderful for studying or working its filled with big and small tables perfect for long days at the coffee shop the only down side is that outlets are at a premium so this may not be the best spot if youre needing to have your laptop plugged in all day other than that this is my go to coffee shop for studying one of the nicest coffee shop atmospheres ive found so far definitely cozy lots of people bring board games on the weekend and spread them out on the large tables they have available somewhat niche coffee and tea options differentiate them from other places as well ample seating almost all of which serves as good workspaces perfect amount of noiseactivity for a cafe not too loud that it becomes distracting and not too quiet that it is uncomfortable keeping a conversation the coffee is delicious and they have creative specialty drinks great cup of drip and americano beautiful room but if i wanted to sit i would probably be out of luck this is used to be a great zoka location and if you want a chill place to do homework or read a book it still is but if you want to buy beans they are pretty old on the shelves and the staff doesnt seem to know when they get deliveries unlike that of the kirkland location we found free street parking 2 blocks away its in a quiter part of town   its good for a quick cup of coffee students and independent workers on their a nice place with customer service leaving something to be desired  just so you are aware the review is based on the quality of the coffee and location this place suuuuuuucks   they are so slow the wifi has a time limit its stupidly expensive the coffee is acidic they are really unfriendly and meh,1087,2200 N

smell of espresso was filling the room nice please for a quick coffee meeting and to rally through some work offline the coffee is bold but not too heavy they have pastries from le panier and the gelato ice cream cones are a fun treat delicious coffee but very dark roast it tastes burnt sometimes the pastries are lovely  try the macarons or the lemon tart when they have them they also have occhi di bue and torta della nonna amazing food  fresh  vegetarian and with light meats  fresh mozzarella salads piadinas sandwiches and they can grill most of it too impressive spread of breakfast good and beverages that are not coffee plenty of seating and dogfriendly definitely worth a stop superb coffees pastries and light meals  my only complaint is that they could use a bus bin because theyre sometimes too busy to send a human busser around one of the best coffee in seattle definitely top five great pastries as well open from 6am on week days excellent coffee but stop by here in the

after all that is what coffee shops are built on people watching some of the best coffee on the city im not sure theres better coffee out there and this one is conveniently located in a tourist area

taco and some vegan donuts for americanos remember that all sizes use two shots of espresso so you might want to add one or two for that extra pick me up they have both a meat and veggie quiche brought in every morning  the selection rotates daily but theyre all a tasty compliment to any espresso drink single origin coffee is rotated in on sundays if youre lucky you can snag some on monday morning here at the alley or up at their other location brix on broadway drip venti trenta you wont find those here dont even try and order it  get an espresso cappuccino latte  tall grande in iced is the largest size served here they are open late 11pm and have a separate room for quiet working or meetings my choices here are either a creamy white velvet or a cafe nico both are wonderful david schomer  geneva sullivan opened the first espresso vivace 20 years ago introducing seattle to the northern italian espresso tradition reddishbrown shots of espresso with a superthick crema wonderful coffee shop tucked across the street from rei best place to park is one block west on the other side of alley24 worth the flight and walk best coffee shop experience seattle has a lot to choose from but this place is a must what to order a straight shot of the dolce espresso of course the vita is only used in drinks with milk and sugar the cafe nico was creamy smooth and heavy with cinnamon

we had a fun time watching the roasting expert cup the coffee don‚Äôt forget to try their inhouse hazelnut milk drink the best we have tried so we came when they were just about to close we were impressed that the guy at the counter was still all about selling us his coffee we had 2 different ethiopian roasts that were featured one filtered and one espresso they were very good complex flavor however the pricing perplexes me it is 3 for the filtered coffee or espresso very reasonable but a 12 oz bag of beans is 21 hence i would get a cup of coffee from here but wont be getting the beans also i wouldnt go out of my way to go here like i would for valhalla in tacoma if i am in the area sure i would give it another go also doesnt yet come close in complexity and overall pleasantness of flavor to my current favorite ride the edge by roast house in spokane 1299 for a lb as we left a woman who works there was holding the door for us and just get out was written all over her face not exactly leaving the best final impression nice place comfortable feel silky smooth latte fruity espresso but not tangy a tad more expensive but it lives up to the price if you like lighter fruitier coffees our pour over were amazing we loved watching them roast while we enjoyed our coffee the interior is very modern and cozy at the same time my coworker a selfproclaimed caffeine addict proclaimed elm coffee roasters to be the best place to go for a coffee in seattle it was indeed a lovely a chill spot in pioneer square to sip a cup of coffee and do some work there arent a lot of

in my opinion try a flight of cold brew wone of their awesome food items my favorite coffee place in seattle this is not the starbucks you know unique high quality drinks and food with a rotating seasonal menu and coffee selection store design is unparalleled starbucks reserve roastery is a sprawling space designed to delight the senses hammered copper silos and wood grains round out  an industrial lab process from bean to brew savor a cup at the bar i sound like such a basic b but this place is amazing mostly for the decorambience love the feel and overall structure cool to see how roasting mechanics happen some unique drinks worth trying try the flights to compare different beans and brewing techniques everything is made in store including all the syrups and pastries grab a seat by the baristas to get the best experience todos los caf√©s son mezclas especiales y hay combinaciones que no se venden en otros starbucks el nitro brew se sirve en grifo como cerveza y est√° muy bueno recomiendo el smoked butterscotch latte seriously impressive and worth the visit even if youre not a coffee drinker they have flights to try at the coffee bar tons of gift items and a roastery for your viewing pleasure a very fancy  expansive tasting room with modern vibe unique selection of starbucks merchandise and more quite touristy but i have to say i had my best starbucks coffee here if you are into coffee this is the place to go a little bit of tea on display and some other things but this is not your typical starbuckstry the whole bean coffee bar to pick up exclusive beans worth a trip for folks visiting from out of town tasting room is gorgeous doesnt serve the normal starbucks menu focused on specialties based on the reserve roasts  a huge plus for me  this is an awesome place to take visitors to seattle who want a coffee experience huge space where you can see them roasting this place is amazing a mix of coffee store roastery flagship store lunch place serious pie the coffee tasting is awesome toothey also have exclusive coffees and beverages must see when in seattle try the shakerato bianco with the ethiopian shot its amazing the shakerato affogato and the espresso macchiato with the ethiopian shot are so good too quick tip on relatively drinkable coffee here 1 spot a type of bean that doesnt look burntsweaty hint coffee beans are brown are not shiny 2 ask for a pourover gorgeous design and amazing detail its still starbucks but they are using different beans they are literally serving better coffee made by better baristas so even if u are skeptical check it out this is a fantastic starbucks do yourself a favour and walkdrive here if you are visiting seattle you wont regret it its amazing surprisingly great coffee starbucks is returning to its roots i had the espresso ethiopian with sweet italian cream be prepared for a long wait if you got a drink wi espresso fun got a vacuum pot of coffee at the slow bar 10 but it was nice strong flavorful smooth coffee and the pot is enough to share great experience see the coffee being roasted and order an espresso flight to your table dont forget to visit the bathroom this is probably how charlie felt when he visited willy wonkas factory this place is 100 cooler than the original starbucks and i suggest getting the nitro coffee this store did what i never thought possible from starbucks they actually made good coffee my cappuccino rivaled that of stumptown and intelligentsia cafes seriously surprised go starbucks sit at the bar and let a barista teach you about the different brewing methods and how they change the coffee great to see different brewing methods up close come to study relax but the coffee is not out of this world its like a playground for coffee lovers make sure to take enough time to walk around and take the selfguided tour hands down the fanciest coffee shop ive ever been ‚ù§Ô∏èÔ∏è their coffee still suck tho maybe someday they learn how to

their frappuccinos and are terrible at guessing one loudly joked about how shes a horrible barista to another none of them could even tell that the java chip i ordered was completely the wrong color because they made me the wrong drink  i could tell from the over 5 feet away that it was a light milky brown instead of a dark brown  i got dirty looks after she remade the drink she didnt measure again despite her coworker telling her to  the barista who took our order that day had quite the attitude when we politely asked if they could make my fianc√© his birthday drink despite him not getting his reward code this year it was his birthday and she was giving him sass for no reason bad service all around here and poor management for hiring horrible baristas who dont care for their jobs one of the nicer starbucks locations right on the water with a patio this place gets absolutely swarmed on nicer days but they handle the crowds pretty well this location is pretty much on par with every other starbucks in the area friendly baristas and less than desirable beverages however beware of the homeless gentleman selling real change outside in the morning hours i walk by here almost every day and this gentleman is usually out front and i always smile hello just as i do with every other person i cross paths with during my walks and he usually remains standing stoically without any response but today he immediately became beligerent and screamed several fbombs at me and accused me of laughing at him i tried to speak with him to clarify me smiling good morning was not laughing at him but he continued his fbombs telling me to keep walking i worry this new irrational behaviour means he has suffered a negative change in his circumstances and im concerned for his wellbeing as well as the wellbeing of others who may be affected by his demeanor take care and be safe i enjoy this place  in my neighborhood green lake  know the baristas  friendly  i can relax here it has lots of seating but much of it is not near any outlet music feels louder than average but it would be a nice place to hang with a couple friends some seating is convenient for strollers even a running preschooler will likely enjoy the more open floorplan but an adult trying to get computer work done may need to get extra friendly with strangers to have a shot at securing one of the coveted outlets there is a somewhat hidden area upstairs including a little patio outside seating downstairs too  its clean kinda crowded but never too crowded lots of stiller yoga moms that let kids run free

creams 5 flavors daily vanilla custard and lemon curd were fantastic finally found my fav donut place i love cream filled donut but not too sweet and those donuts are those the only thing is if the filling can be just a little more it will be wonderful the sugardusted cloud puffs called yeasted doughnuts piped with nottoosweet fillings like lemon curd and honey yogurt left us in a state of speechless euphoria light fluffy yeastrollesque donut with a cream filling thats not too sweet  might be the best donut ive ever had  im not a big fan of rich cake style donuts so this is perfect for me vanilla custard is heavy with real vanilla flavor lemon custard is so tart and delicious great place for a little extra special breakfast treat try 12 donuts wa friend as theyre too rich to sample and eat alone donuts are powdered with sugar and stuffed with curds creams and jams ingredients are derived from local sources easily the best donut ive had in years they might only do filled donuts but by specializing gp has crafted something exceptional get the date shake donut and the vanilla custard the brown sugar latte is probably my favorite in the city and they have an excellent rotating menu of custard filled donuts if you like those small pastry shops in san francisco this feels exactly the same especially on a sunny day get the chocolate marshmallow smooth coffee and even smoother donuts theyre open only till 3pm coz they share a kitchen with restaurant next door donuts are really good and they do sell out one note the donuts can be quite expensive they run almost 5 each  coffee donuts  its all good i highly recommend ordering a brewed coffee let them pick and a donut then getting 4 more to go marshmallow chocolate is fluffy and chocolatey and deliciousy love the filled donuts unlike crappy top pot they dont run out in 2 hours and the taste is far better than anything else you get in seattle amazing doughnuts especially the one with dates staff is super friendly as well great place overall highly recommended great filled donuts forgot to add that you should get there early as they often sell out by the afternoon get there early or else you wont get a delicious doughnut vanilla cream just the right amount of sweet lemon curd is a little sour but good if you like intense lemon flavor everything is good here cant go wrong with classic cream or the tart and bright lemon üçã vanilla custard and the chocolate marshmallow doughnuts are crazy good vanilla creme  enjoyed every glorious mouthful buy one in each flavour  leave with no regrets tried em all so you dont have to ‚Äî vanilla custard is the best great ambiance fillings are light and yummy but the donuts are very oily and dense super light and fluffy you cant go wrong with a classic vanilla custard the vanilla custard filled doughnut is one of my new favorite things delicious sugar raised donuts with rotating fillings 5 per day exquisite try the chocolate marshmallow or vanilla custard melt in your mouth lemon curd donut and oolong tea what a treat i got the lemon curd donut because i wanted something tart delicious seasonal donut flavor changes frequently such a great doughnut and chill spot get the vanilla custard filled doughnut üòç really delicious donuts close to a few good brunch places fruitcream berliners are teh shit also excellent espresso drinks but

arrive early lemon donuts great service vanilla  lemon curd donuts üëçüèº üç©‚òïÔ∏è small place but the decor is beautiful and homey go early to ensure that you get some donuts but we went after brunch on the weekend and were fine the donut itself is fairly basic but the filling is what makes the donut its not too sweet and they have a couple different flavors all of which are great for the pricing i wouldnt go everyday but its a nice treat every once in a while great atmosphere service and to die donuts  the fillings are so yummy  i had the cherry  cream this morning   mmm  try the seasonal ones and the always flavors the lemon curd was not too sweet and had just the right amount of tartness the yeast dough was soft with some chew try to go early in the morning or afternoon for best texture and freshness this review is based only on their doughnuts not anything else they serve i had the lemon curd and vanilla cream aside from being 4 each there was a weird after taste with the dough overall just not worth the cost and they dont even taste that great beautiful open seating with very tasty donuts for sure the vanilla and lemon cream we got were rich but not too sweet fluffy and airy the hot chocolate was meh though  stick to coffees ,981,1060 E Union St

caffe del sol pacnor wow take your dogs to cafe vita for a latte and a treat for the pups  the sign outside says no dogs but they love them inside quiter brighter and better views upstairs to me they got the best latte crazy bum at vita not cool kinda gross bathroom  more plugs upstairs blackberry izze had coffee with kenji and rory a capitol hill institution its coffee is pleasant enough and the staff are polite and professional the baked goods arent anything remarkable but they suffice in a pinch if one is in need of a quick snack but the missing ingredient to vita is the absence of their upstairs seating area now an office space its not the end of the world but the upstairs like the one at the erstwhile bauhaus was a different and calmer world altogether it provided a view of the street and was bathed in the reflected light of the neighbouring buildings it was a place of uncommon repose though only slightly less grand than that of bauhauss latticed ersatz promontory students gathered there to study and debate in hushed tones games were played books were read in peace no more vita is good enough but it could be better i tagged along with a friend who loves their coffee to be fair im not a big coffee person and i dont think their vibe really gels with me feels a bit more like a nightclub than a cafe very dim lighting with red neon lights also got a tea and the tea bag ripped so i was just casually spitting out bits of earl grey every sip   but if you love coffee and youre into more funky atmospheres im sure vita is for you also their lids are very cool good coffee and a good place to sit by the window for people watching this is a local favorite and always busy no matter what day or time  id go  here to get a cup of coffee read a book work or just sit back and enjoy people watching easy place to strike a conversation with locals and relax  if you pay 1 more you can get a refill on your coffee  üëç a cool place to grab a lovely cup of coffee and do some work or chat with a friend easy to connect to wifi and there are several places to plug in   it offers a selection of different brew methods the atmosphere is a bit darker than some of the other whitewalled modern coffee shops opening up which makes it different good for drippour over coffee  i ordered an espresso but it was the wrong beans for it it tasted sour i think this place is better for drip or pour over coffee also the place is very dark pretty good coffee and pretty much the roasting and distribution hub for their coffee i had seen their coffee classes before ordered or noticed cafes and pretty chill coffee house when we went they were playing some rock music which is not really what id expect but it went with the goth vibe of the the line was long we were surprised ive never seen a line that long in any coffee shop except the starbucks at the outlet mall people must really like,1302,1005 E Pike St

sandwich yum sulawesi toraja salami minanga is in  watery ass chai latte disgusting make fun of the pretention and laptop hate coffeeeeeee after visiting a few times i feel like i can finally offer an honest review of victrola coffee and art peering in the windows from time to time on the way home this coffee shop had sparked my interest as nearly all of the tables were filled it always looked lively and friendly   the first night i went in i had caught a lull in customers at the time everyone had already been seated with their orders i ordered my drink and a sandwich after some careful consideration the staff was soso they werent friendly but not horrible either i sat down with my hot drink and waited for my sandwich to be warmed up after 15 minutes and one customer after me i finally asked about my hot sandwich i had ordered oh sorry then i was handed a cold sandwich   sitting from my table i watched as business started to pick up i wasnt the only one who had ordered something that was forgotten especially a food item those people were also handed cold food after waiting for their order a few drinks were missed all together the staff would apologize but it was lackluster ive been there being a barista is harder than it looks and calls for lots of multitasking it comes down to this were all human and things get missed but putting some sincerity into apologies can go a long way   my following two visits were more of the same the drinks were eh   and the staff were eh for me this is part of the coffee shop experience and it just wasnt there genuine interaction with patrons and engaging with them even if its simply asking how their day was is a huge way to connect with people  i can note that victrola coffee seems to be a popular place for meetups and gatherings in my time visiting most of the tables were full of people this coffee shop does seem to attract a community of friends and family despite the disconnect with the staff the coffee shop has been kept clean and tidy love the coffee and the artwork and ambience good choices not great does it all have to be healthy the environment was good for our meeting quiet rumble the tea was yummy need to study work or just want to enjoy coffee this coffee shop is for you be advised there usually is not seating available during peak times free refill for house coffee good for working on laptop many plugs chairs cool cozy place small snacks tea and variety of coffee are available the staff here is super friendly the man who assisted me gave me tips on how to make my own ginger beer the environment is relaxing and the perfect way back when i enjoyed hanging out at victrola on 15th ave e to read write have a mocha and people watch  meandered through this section of

miles south of here and very good the ambiance was cozy and inviting feels like a best kept secret sort of place id recommend this place to anyone things i liked food turned out to be better than i expected and more filling than i expected coffee was good checkout person was friendly and smiled  drawbacks 1 the wait just if youre hitting it at a popular time plan to wait simple as that people are pretty chill it just is what it is but it can be very slow 2 there isnt coffee while waiting have to get up to the register and order before being able to get coffee 3 its quite pricey i heard its basically all organic locally sourced ingredients so you gotta plan to pay a bit extra for that but youre not going to find any deals on this menu 4 not really enough seating space 5 the system for getting ones food go up stand in  right next to the line for ordering ones food angering people who are wondering if youre cutting and also people sitting at tables right next to said line hope to hear your name called amongst the din is kind of a cluster  overall i probably wouldnt go back but i guess everyone should try it once if you like the wealthy yuppie vibe and all the good things that go with that this is the spot if it were a little quieter to be fair i hit it at prime brunch time on a weekend it could be good great cozy brunch place in an old house in a residential area matzo ball soup and latte were exceptional lively neighborhood vibe i love vpc  baked goods are awesome and such a nice spot to hang out and have a coffee with a friend i like to get there early to avoid the lines and not feel bad about taking up a spot for a long time but i also like sharing the long table with strangers  very nonseattley way to eat your breakfast what a delight  this is a small neighborhood cafe at the corner of 17th and ne galer that was once a local grocery store  it boasts a small but wonderful menu of both vegetarian and meat sandwiches soups salads and breakfast items all made with fresh and homemade ingredients including mama lils peppers delicious   they offer unique dessert options as well including a huge cookie with peanut butter peppers and lime  it sounds like nothing that would go together but i tried it and it was uniquely delicious wowthis is a great place to eat breakfast lunch or dinner on capitol hill  will definitely go back there volunteer park cafe is one of my favorite places to have breakfast or lunch during the week  not a lot places offer that so its a major plus  all the after coming here quite a few times over the years i have to say i am finally breaking up with vpc never to return   1 one of the women at the register lightly spiced by perfectly balanced chai latte that sometimes i drink one with breakfast and then get one to go as i leave excessive maybe i loved the,1416,1501 17th Ave E

set up a gathering with a group of friends once and the white host and continuously addressed my friend right in front of me with questions about attendees and payment etc even after i told her i was the organizer and after my friend stated she didn‚Äôt know anything because she didn‚Äôt organize the event and she was very passive aggressive towards me i had lunch here on a thursday afternoon seating was immediate the food was fantasic if you order the specials that you think would be ordinary you will find a twist in the flavor of the food that makes them amazing  big portions too i should have quit eating before i did leaving some of the entree on the plate but it tasted so good that i could not quit until the food was gone  the service was over the top i would give them more than 5 stars if i could i will definitely be back soon  1 star the restaurant was cute clean and fit perfectly in the old downtown feel in that area of columbia city  1 star good service always came back pretty rare i give a solid 5 stars on yelp but jill was an amazing server customer service was top notch we came right before happy hour within 10 aside from the fact that tutta bella is in colombia city a fairly cool district of seattle the restaurant doesnt really stand out from the crowd  the,953,4918 Rainier Ave S
