the back for kids and their parents out of the way of other customers so not to disturb them but allows parents to relax while the kids have a lot to play with i love this place try a chai with rice milk on a cold day to warn you up and grab a chipotle ham sandwich too another sign i saw advertises organic high mountain iced black tea  also sounds tasty family friendly coffee shop they have a separate room with small chairs and toys just for kids nice people good hot chocolate but the wifi rarely works and required reloggingin ever 15 minutes when it does great place to relax not a great place to work very friendly employees good place to enjoy a coffee while your children play the cookies and banana bread are meh coffee is vita but its great to have a separate area for families bring your laptop so you can work while the kids play i really like log cabin atmosphere of this coffee house batistas are cool the wifi is slower than atts 3g service on my iphone  im getting about 12 mbps dwn  sign i saw today advertised organic coldbrew toddy sounds good amazing lavender white mochas they make my heart happy uf49c try a lavender white chocolate mocha and take a few sips over by the fireplace mmmm i love the dirty chais chai tea latte white choco mocha and almond croissant spiced chai tea oh yeah good coffee mmmmm great little place and i say that not just because i know the owner it has a very cozy homey vibe serves fantastic coffee and very good sandwiches the little kids play room in the back is a wonderful addition too will definitely be back staff is extremely friendly hours suck though and the drinks are made so slowly still better than starbucks a fine place to kill time if youre in the area but not worth a special trip they do have a separate room for people with little children though so a nice work environment for people who want a little distance from the chaos of kiddos nice atmosphere comfortable seating good wifi connection terrible customer service and acidic coffee barista was rude to me feminists predominate as baristas here their misandry and baseness are par for the course overview the coffee is decent but im giving it an above average rating for service  the staff here are friendly and very helpful so im a fan  this five stars because service is always great and it has a nice and spacious playroom also the dedicated parking lot is a huge plus read i suck at parallel family visit in a fall morning hot cocoa son said no chocolate mom ordered a eggnog latte no eggnogdad vanilla latte hmmmm  i will leave it,549

half the ingredients needed to make a proper ceasar salad i was mad that i was so hungry and in a hurry that i had to pay for junk they mixed up my leftovers with someone elses the service was very

your drink its a handcrafted shot made with espresso and raw sugar only available at the original starbucks длинная очередь но чтобы ощутить атмосферу первого в мире можно и постоять обязательна к покупке чашка the original starbucks it is tastier coffee here ordering is easy the barista is overworked its every coffee lovers mecca and its a relatively small place so its crazy crowded all day every day a starbucks coffee company sempre foi o local onde se encontrava invariavelmente o melhor sortimento de cafés do mundo inteiro whats different about this store one of the last to use a semiautomatic espresso machine strong and fuller espresso try a shot great for souvenirs make sure to get there early to beat the line the original store yet just a regular starbucks get ready for a huge line starbucks partners are wonderful the birthplace of the mermaid is always a treat to visit and i want more pike place special reserve 301  the first store although actually the fourth store after university of washington in 72 and capitol hill in 73 the original location was torn down in 1974 the first starbucks the only one like it yes its just a starbucks but this one still has the original brown siren logo yay for starbuzzle ue00eue106ue045 it was cool to visit the original starbucks it has exclusive merchandise in the store but unless youre going to it for the merch its just a normal starbucks and therefore not worth the wait at the original usually theres a line out the door so dont expect a quick stop 3 have a coffee date at the 1st starbucks in seattle 3 share a cup of coffee the way its meant to be 3 dont grab the mugs on the shelf  this store has unopened packages  behind the register super friendly staff and service love my time in here go early in the morning because the line does go out the door at peak times get here at opening time if you cant deal with a long line of tourists snapping photos the original worth stopping by if you’re in the area this is the first starbucks ever and it felt great to be there honestly go on a weeknight after the market closes and you wont have to wait on a line of 50 people to get in be kind to the baristas and tip they are the hardest working and busiest baristas in the world no joke one of those things u do when u come to seattle nothing to rave about regular service 2 of 4 petals via fondu no trip is complete without a visit to the original awesome staff who know their coffee make sure you head down the block to visit the gum wall in post alley it’s pretty cool if you can get over the “used gum” factor original starbucks sells exclusive mugs there is always a line здесь только кофе и сувениры но какойнибудь тамблер купить обязательно и кофе в него сразу тоже ☕️ the coffee actually tastes superior to other  starbucks in the area thanks to the la marzocco machine and also has super hot batistas make sure you head down the block to visit the gum wall in post alley it’s pretty cool if you can get

little bit slow whats different in this 1st starbucks tell the barista its ur bday and next thing u know all the people in the starbucks are singing good times coffee and seattle how can you go wrong

primer starbucks café de la reserva especial sólo se vende en esta la primera tienda starbucks dddddddddddd wouldnt mind a cup of starbucks later this afternoonevening hi ummmmmm slowest baristas ever ate they trying to keep tourists here longer so they buy more swag nyeeehh just test purely a tourist trap there is nothing spectacular here even the souvenirs are a letdown  if you really want the authentic seattle coffee experience try victrola in cap hill i’m normally not the biggest fan of hot coffee as i usually go with the ice option but i ventured out and tried the pikes place roast as it is unique to this location it was extremely tasty the line for ordering coffee stretched out the door but they had an associate just inside directing traffic and answering any questions that customers had overall the coffee was worth the wait and it was a neat experience for something that has become so mainstream another great starbucks location i enjoy the baristas young friendly and super helpful if you prefer a less strong cup of coffee order an ed half coffee hot water this was quite the experience  i took the opportunity to wonder in stop take a moment and inhale all the aromas that a typical coffee shop has to offer and enjoy the unique memorabilia that this store offers  a barista was out stocking up merchandise and took time to answer my questions as well as explain to me what makes the store unique  she also provided me with recommendations on the coffees that one can only get there  i must say that giving in is not so much of a bad thing when youre just standing there being vulnerable it was cool to visit the 1st starbucks even if i am not a coffee drinker  the area is trendy and the market across the street is very interesting  well with a trip to the area to check it all out how can you rate this less than 5 stars this is the original starbucks complete with the old logo and everything there is always a long line i actually left the first time saying to myself that ill come back i did same line but in true starbucks fashion the long moved along swiftly this is a must visit i believe that the 1st  pike starbucks is one of the most famous tourists sites in seattle and coffee is something extra there i went there at 530 pm on i visited seattle for the first time and like most tourists i wanted to visit the first starbucks location when i got there there was a huge line of first off this is not the first starbucks the first one burned down but the emblem from the first store is placed at this store   the line is super long,4436

european style hot chocolate they have it at the pioneer square location ask for it specifically their regular one is more like the cocoa drink at the pioneer square location ask for their speciality coffee menu which is not displayed on the wall nice little clean cafe with great espresso what stands out about this coffee shop is that they not only offer plenty of pastries and baked goods but also its the second time i came and the atmosphere is not very welcoming the barrista didnt say hi when i came in he does not smile and he actually is quite dropped in on a rainy sunday for some espresso about as stereotypically seattle as it gets  the space is welcoming and the coffee is excellent this,1005

and italian soda the baristas are always friendly tip well best coffee in seattle maybe in usa as i visited alot of cities in different state and the staff are very friendly but they have to look for the pastries they always out of them the focus here is very specific—no drip coffee just espresso drinks made from arabica beans they have been roasting in the northern italian style since 1992 they have a vegan soyrizo breakfast taco and some vegan donuts for americanos remember that all sizes use two shots of espresso so you might want to add one or two for that extra pick me up they have both a meat and veggie quiche brought in every morning  the selection rotates daily but theyre all a tasty compliment to any espresso drink single origin coffee is rotated in on sundays if youre lucky you can snag some on monday morning here at the alley or up at their other location brix on broadway drip venti trenta you wont find those here dont even try and order it  get an espresso cappuccino latte  tall grande in iced is the largest size served here they are open late 11pm and have a separate room for quiet working or meetings my choices here are either a creamy white velvet or a cafe nico both

with great latte love the industrial high ceiling with wooden deco free wifi around 20 people seating including counter really nice coffee house i ordered an iced latte and a vanilla cake donut the coffee was very good and so was the cake highly recommend this place if you are a lover of good coffee i got the iced latte and chocolate chip cookie both were great nice shop to work out of and the prices are pretty reasonable too an excellent latte along with an iced vanilla latte that my normally frappacino drinking wife liked relaxing chill space to kick back and enjoy a drink bonusthey sell merch with their cool logo killer coffee loved the atmosphere and the baristas were nice not a good place to go if youre also looking for a bite to eat only had small cakes and cookies got a simple but tasty iced coffee unfortunately no cold brew or outlets for your computer all in all good music simple industrial feel and good coffee top notch house roasted coffee beans and awesome vibes plenty of space to get work done or catch up with old friends nice open space where you can watch them roasting beans while you enjoy a cortado the light is just right as is their cortado sometimes the machines whir in the background giving you the perfect white noise to get work done modern and hip place resembles very much to cafes in portland their single origin espresso is the best avoid mocha though possibly my favorite coffee shop in pioneer square the espresso is consistently excellent and the harbor herbalist teas are lovely highly recommended loved this place great vibes tasty coffee bought some filter coffee for home try tasting menu for 5  coolest cafe in seattle sensible passionate staff quality coffee sickass ambience and a darn right sexy logo if i do say so myself single origin espresso was perfection smooth with beautiful crema all coffee roasted on site pretty large hangout space too non dairy options are soy or house made hazelnut milk  i opted for the hazelnut milk and was not disappointed americano is really great and their rotating drip coffee is quite excellent overall everything is a bit pricey though wifi password may 2016 coffeeisgood nice cozy place to sit down and work but there are no power plugs try to stick with the espressomilk drinks their filtered coffee is pretty nasty new hip coffee shop at pioneer square good coffee and staff get a single origin espresso with a chocolate chip cookie youll thank me later one of the best tasting lattes ive had in a long time beautiful shop too the space is beautiful and the coffee delicious plus it is very good to work focused really nice space and an excellent latte try their hazelnut milk made inhouse feels like a hidden gem in the area great espresso quiet place to work for a bit beautifully designed shop lots of natural light coffee was great their homemade hazelnut milk is so delicious even on its own such a great place to start the day before going into the office 😀 awesome coffee in seattle definitely must to visit the roaster great espresso the white noise generated while they are roasting creates a relaxing environment to slurp espresso in the single origin is amazing it was ethiopian the day i went elm coffee roasters offers batch brew coffee and espressobased drinks good atmosphere to go with excellent coffee good uncrowded coffee shop tried their capp creammy find a nice table grab yourself a 12 ounce latte and bring a good book to read 👍 hazelnut milk and vegan donuts are delicious clean modern atmosphere that you can get some work done in one of the good coffee spots in pioneer square coffee far exceeded my expectations well worth the walk there cool place to grab a coffee friendly service try the coffee the filter coffee is excellent have a single origin espresso shot at the bar excellent space with good coffee and treats from the london plane you can watch the roasting real time smells amazing get the brewed coffee its better than the pour overs at most other places good drip coffee though no pourover or other filter options trendy fit out nice and spacious сюда стоит заглянуть спокойно и хороший кофе another cool spot to chill at the pioneer square area the best coffee i’ve ever tasted even the regular drip is amazing single origin espresso is the ticket best coffee why would anyone go to starbucks get the espresso and tonic its amazing best coffee i had in seattle very thoughtful and well selected tea offerings cute place  great espresso mighty o doughnuts and cardamom bread   sparkling iced coffee is something different good donuts and coffee legit lattes were excellent never disappoints 😋 disappointed in their espresso  way too nutty flavored for my taste pioneer square not a fan of their coffeetoo sour for my taste bad attitude even filtered coffee was bad a chill spot in pioneer square to sip a cup of coffee and do some work there arent a lot of plugs i actually didnt see any so make sure your laptop is charged  the coffee was enjoyable and served in a beautiful grayish blue cup the establishment has a modern style of decoration with white walls and organic accents the staff were cool and friendly to those who seemed to be regulars i received a weird vibe from some but im sure it wasnt anything   overall i enjoyed my visit and coffee here very nice coffee fruity and not too heavily roasted one if the few places where they roast their coffee we had a fun time watching the roasting expert cup the coffee don’t forget to try their inhouse hazelnut milk drink the best we have tried so we came when they were just about to close we were impressed that the guy at the counter was still all about selling us his coffee we had 2 different ethiopian roasts that were featured one filtered and one espresso they were very good complex flavor however the pricing perplexes me it is 3 for the filtered coffee or espresso very reasonable but a 12 oz bag of beans is 21 hence i would get a cup of coffee from here but wont be getting the beans also i wouldnt go out of my way to go here like i would for valhalla in tacoma if i am in the area sure i would give it another go also doesnt yet come close in complexity and overall pleasantness of flavor to my current favorite ride the edge by roast house in spokane 1299 for a lb as we left a woman who works there was holding the door for us and just get out was written all over her face not exactly leaving the best final impression nice place comfortable feel silky smooth latte fruity espresso but not tangy a tad more expensive but it lives up to the price if you like lighter fruitier coffees our pour over were amazing we loved watching them roast while we enjoyed our coffee the interior is very modern and cozy at the same time my coworker a selfproclaimed caffeine addict proclaimed elm coffee roasters to be the best place to go for a coffee in seattle it was indeed a lovely a chill spot in pioneer square to sip a cup of coffee and do

treats and fun vibe i always stop by when i’m in the neighborhood an average sized cafe with a usually chill atmosphere although it can get a bit louder at peak times due to the tables being close together not that many places to get work done but a good hangout spot for small meetings most baristas make average or above average drinks great coffee atmosphere for working but closes only at 6 pm couches have pet hair on them and most importantly the baristas are rude and i feel like are racist especially in the evening they are groggy i left good tips still they are groggy i wish they improve their customer service and extend cafe course and it will be great place to be as the coffee shop that is right around the corner from me id take this spot over starbucks any day its a real neighborhood atmosphere and the staff is really nice the cozy living room furniture make me want to stay there all day and while i havent had any sweets they sure look good the coffee drinks are made perfectly and you can get your latte art fix too if thats your thing free wifi a fun atmosphere note that in the morning they really hustle to get you your drink while waiting for the bus my only gripe is that sometimes the line gets long relaxing place for a cup of coffee   nice atmosphere  easy access  good food and coffee great coffee friendly and courteous staff clean spacious and again

perfect mixture of salty and sweet   the bakery is pretty no frills on the inside but their pastries are very good my only wish is that they could offer directly to warm up pastries really clean and bright delicious baked goods the salted caramel croissant was fantastic and theyre dog friendly a new favorite place super cute cafe their cakes and pastries are amazing staff are very friendly and helpful i love their red velvet cupcakes so moist and delicious definitely recommend it if you’re in the area while ive never been to sugar bakery i have had several items from uber eats and boy they can bake  i had a the turkey havarti  cranberry sandwich on a i visit every time im in seattle for a vegan muffin and perfect americano qunynh is the best friendly and knows her way around an espresso machine  my i had a early body check at virginia mason and i got a bit of time to enjoy some breakfast before work so i say why not somewhere around here and that,637

I knew that, although I was with her frequently and doing things with her, I could not possibly give her the care and activities I knew she would need. Mom and I had visited other retirement communities and mom was very adamant that she did not like their environments or décor. For my own part, I wasn\'t very encouraged about either what we\'d seen or by my mother\'s reaction.\n\nOne day, after our weekly routine of shopping at Northgate, mom suggested we visit Aljoya. We made an appointment and the moment we walked in mom smiled, breathed in the aroma of the espresso in the Bistro and said “This is it!” She was of course very impressed by the elegance in the décor and the bright warm colors. (She often complained that most of the other facilities were depressing in colors etc.) \nWhat impressed me the most were the employees. To this day, 2 ½ years later, the employees are the most amazing group of people of all ages who always have a smile, who greet everyone by name and enthusiastically always try to do something  to help residents and visiting family members. \n\nThe Wellness center, headed by Annie Atienza R.N., who is our number one “Angel,” as my mother calls her, and all of her staff have become an extension of our family.  They monitor mother daily and all of her vitals and are sure not only to watch over medical needs but also her psychological and emotional needs. \n\nIt is clear that Eli and Rebecca Almo and their amazing son, Jacob, have approached the creation of their facility as though they were creating a home for one of their own family members. They have not overlooked a single detail, from the outstanding staff that they hire and train to the smallest details of fresh flowers on the dining room tables to bowls of fresh fruit available to the residents as they wander throughout the complex. \n\nThe Almos are an extremely caring family, who are concerned about their residents from the day they walk in to the days that follow as some residents become more frail or ill. They have been a huge and very responsive support system to my family. I truly do not know what I would do or where I would have been able to turn in these recent months as my mother has continued to decline.  \n\nAt Aljoya the Almos have created a positive caring community. From those who work there to the other residents who live there, Aljoya has provided a welcoming neighborhood that surrounds my mother with life, love and caring. In many respects, giving up living ""on her own"" in her later years has been a gain and a blessing, not an ever increasing struggle. It has in fact brought her new comforts, new security and a new environment of great beauty.\n\nBecause of Aljoya, the staff and the Almos my mother will be able to live her last days in a warm and friendly atmosphere with exceptional nursing care and surrounded by her own personal possessions and family by her side.  We can’t thank everyone enough for all that they do every day and what they have done these past 2 ½ years. \n', '', '']",,[],come aljoya market day for your veggies  pastries today at 4pm cash credit

they hold it down i love french cuisine and this place did not disappoint we thoroughly enjoyed all of our dishes especially the carrots dish with trout option and croquemonsieur best item on the combo charcuterie plate was the pork rilettes were looking forward to be back again some minor complaints are our waitress did not seem friendly at all she did her job but without a smile everybody else was great also not sure what the point is for offering tongue in the charcuterie plate experience maybe it didnt taste like anything that was the only thing i didnt care for fantastic frenchstyle café i could eat their charcuterie all day honestly i could just eat their bread and jam all day we always have great service and leave happy the chocolat chaud is to die for cafe presse is the perfect cafe it has breakfast lunch and dinner food all the time some casual some fancy some snacky if you just want chocolate and champagne you can do it if you want salad and wine  you can do it if

youngsters unique biscuit sammys with different options of biscuits to choose from great coffee loved the food and ambience months later and we still talk about those amazing breakfast sandwiches we had we lived in seattle for years and never came here we visited over thanksgiving and immediately realized we had been missing out on a breakfast eden go here your stomach never forgets it’s first time biscuits were baked perfectly crunchy outside softflakey outside gravy was beyond tasty asked for a side of each style and was given a healthy portion of each any true biscuits and gravy fan knows u dont skimp on the gravy a must try for any biscuits and gravy fan in the area get there early i went on a saturday 15 mins after it opened and there was already a line but well worth the wait the service is friendly and quick the biscuits are colossal in size and flavor we ordered the biscuit sandwich with bacon and biscuits  gracyboth so tasty were already talking about returning to satisfy our cravings that have crept back cute and casual breakfast spot i love their different flavors of biscuits you can order the biscuits alone or get one of their sandwiches i tried the morsel is cute and homey a nice ambiance that resembles a hipster coffee place with the space constraint it may be a grab for seats during busy periods super hipster type of breakfast spot its definitely a hole in the wall type if place easy to miss if you are driving by and distracted by the street and,870

Peering in the windows from time to time on the way home, this coffee shop had sparked my interest as nearly all of the tables were filled. It always looked lively and friendly. \n\nThe first night I went in, I had caught a lull in customers at the time. Everyone had already been seated with their orders. I ordered my drink and a sandwich after some careful consideration. The staff was so-so. They weren\'t friendly, but not horrible either. I sat down with my hot drink and waited for my sandwich to be warmed up. After 15 minutes and one customer after me, I finally asked about my hot sandwich I had ordered. ""Oh. Sorry."" Then I was handed a cold sandwich. \n\nSitting from my table, I watched as business started to pick up. I wasn\'t the only one who had ordered something that was forgotten, especially a food item. Those people were also handed cold food after waiting for their order, a few drinks were missed all together. The staff would apologize, but it was lackluster. I\'ve been there. Being a barista is harder than it looks and calls for lots of multitasking. It comes down to this: We\'re all human and things get missed, but putting some sincerity into apologies can go a long way. \n\nMy following two visits were more of the same. The drinks were eh. . . and the staff were eh. For me, this is part of the coffee shop experience and it just wasn\'t there. Genuine interaction with patrons and engaging with them even if its simply asking how their day was is a huge way to connect with people.\n\nI can note that Victrola coffee seems to be a popular place for meetups and gatherings. In my time visiting, most of the tables were full of people. This coffee shop does seem to attract a community of friends and family, despite the disconnect with the staff. The coffee shop has been kept clean and tidy.', 'Love the coffee and the artwork and ambience. Good choices not great. Does it all have to be healthy??', 'The environment was good for our meeting. Quiet rumble. The tea was yummy.', 'Need to study, work, or just want to enjoy coffee? This coffee shop is for you. Be advised, there usually is not seating available during peak times!', 'Free refill for house coffee. Good for working on laptop, many plugs, chairs.

toasted coconut open faced mushroom sandwich and raspberry mint lemonade uf604 molly moon chef of molly moons eats here on her nights off she loves the chocolate croissant toffee bread pudding check out volunteer park cafe as seen on unique sweets such extreme locavorism admittedly is rare—but many regard farmtotable dining an essential part of their job comfort food  good coffee 👏🏻 overrated place very noisy and crowded the space is maxed out so people are constantly running into you the food is ok staff rather unfriendly for seattle standards great atmosphere even better chicken apple salad strawberry nutella panini do it do yourself a favor and order the french dip feels like eating a meal at your mothers kitchen tableif your mother was a hipster martha stewart having no vegetarian food outside salads is very 90s 😲 the place is beautiful during night caramelized banana brioche french toast goes hella hard a must order yummy eats fun space great attitude everything love the breakfast panini go for brunch then get some cookies to go  and enjoy at the park smore cookie try it excellent great people watching everything is good but the almond croissant will change your life so perfect on a sunny day with friends have a latte and a pear  cardamom muffin pulled pork is amazing excellent prices and location right in the middle of a nice residential area on the north end of capitol hill we attended for dinner and the food was very reasonably priced compared to equivalent fare a few miles south of here and very good the ambiance was cozy and inviting feels like a best kept secret sort of place id recommend this place to anyone things i liked food turned out to be better than i expected and more filling than i expected coffee was good checkout person was friendly and smiled  drawbacks 1 the wait just if youre hitting it at a popular time plan to wait simple as that people are pretty chill it just is what it is but it can be very slow 2 there isnt coffee while waiting have to get up to the register and order before being able to get coffee 3 its quite pricey i heard its basically all organic locally sourced ingredients so you gotta plan to pay a bit extra for that but youre not going to find any deals on this menu 4 not really enough seating space 5 the system for getting ones food go up stand in  right next to the line for ordering ones food angering people who are wondering if youre cutting and also people sitting at tables right next to said line hope to hear your name called amongst the din is kind of a cluster  overall i probably wouldnt go back but i guess everyone should try it once if you like the wealthy yuppie vibe and all the good things that go with that this is the spot if it were a little quieter to be fair i hit it at prime brunch time on a weekend it could be good great cozy brunch place in an old house in a residential area matzo ball soup and latte were exceptional lively neighborhood vibe i love vpc  baked goods are awesome and such a nice spot to hang out and have a coffee with a friend i like to get there early to avoid the lines and not feel bad about taking up a spot for a long time but i also like sharing the long table with strangers  very nonseattley way to eat your breakfast what a delight  this is a small neighborhood cafe at the corner of 17th and ne galer that was once a local grocery store  it boasts a small but wonderful menu of both vegetarian and meat sandwiches soups salads and breakfast items all made with fresh and homemade ingredients including mama lils peppers delicious   they offer unique dessert options as well including a huge cookie with peanut butter peppers and lime  it sounds like nothing that would go together but i tried it and it was uniquely delicious wowthis is a great place to eat breakfast lunch or dinner on capitol hill  will definitely go back there volunteer park cafe is one of my favorite places to have breakfast or lunch during the week  not a lot places offer that so its a major plus  all the after coming here quite a few times over the years i have to say i am finally breaking up with vpc never to return   1 one of the women at the register lightly spiced by perfectly balanced chai latte that sometimes i drink one with breakfast and then get one to go as i leave excessive maybe i loved the,1416

starbucks around campus great spot to study great place to study its open late and is in a good location lots of seating occasionally its packed but youll manage  only critique is the bathroom is pretty small expect it to be packed with a primarily uw crowd during the school year great study environment with tons of seating 100 seats and some outdoor spots too otherwise your normal run of the mill starbucks,the location is massive a great cafe to work alone or with groups there is tons of seating to include bars and tables and a huge outdoor communal wooden not sure why this starbucks gets such great ratings  the place is large and there are a ton of tables however the place is packed with students camping at i cant function without my cold brew in the mornings so im so glad that there are so many starbucks locations in this area but to be completely,its actually a very nice starbucks its just always completely packed and you end up shoulder to shoulder with people get a coffee here and then wander around the village instead the more i try it the less i like starbucks clover  overextracted and overroasted it all ends up sickly sweet  if you want to see what the clover can really do try aster in ballard if you get a cappuccino or latte make sure to get them to sprinkle some cinnamon sugar on the top its delicious great starbucks with presently of outlets on the walls in the corners and on floors by the high tops lines at the largest store in uvillage look crazy long but they move quick plus you get clover coffee here nom you have 2 in u village i like the one that is tucked away on the end nearest to office depot bc the workers there r boss this is probably the best starbucks in town two clover machines try the komodo dragon if you really want a lift if you have a laptop look for a spot at the long wooden tables theyre the only spots with plugins try the clover brew its so much better than drip and if its your first time ask the batista for a suggestion theyre great at giving ideas the manager here has put together a great team of partners always great service and good coffee they had cups of ice water sitting on the counter for people to take  great if you just walked down 45th there are three starbucks at u village go to the one by office depot 15 min parking always open at least for me it is d foursquare currently shows this sbux as closing at 2pm on

coconut milk latte  eggnog cake donut best doughnuts ive had so far this site also had a better selection than usual and that one hour before they closed nice location quit and its designed like a mini library sitting area with real books to read the donuts are not as good as i remember from other locations ive been to 3 years ago but still very satisfyingly good for a growing chain good spot for higher quality donuts that youre used to creative flavors good variety and the option for plain cakes makes my world go round awesome staff i will say that these arent really much to write home about theyre pretty much just regular donuts apart from their seasonals no apple chunks in the apple fritter is definitely a disappointment my suggestion is to visit the qfc down the street and pick up an assorted dozen at the end of the day for 5 the donuts in the shop can get really pricey,revisited top pot in wedgwood with the homie 81417 its been awhile with the giant doughnut and palm trees along ne 35th more famillies here than hmm donuts  i like this little neighborhood donut shop there is a huge tasty selection of donuts the raised donuts are nice moist and fluffy the id heard so much about top pot donuts and saw this shop on the way to the uw so we stopped in my son got an eggnog donut and i got a chocolate cake donut,top pot donuts are very popular in seattle  this is the wedgwood location ive never been inside but id like to go  ive been to the downtown location they were good donuts best doughnut at top pot the plain old fashioned yum espresso  good cappuccino ok a little disappointing made a great outing for the family however not quite the tastiest doughnuts ive ever had the drip coffee was amazing though if homer simpson could live anywhere he would likely choose somewhere near top pot wedgwood or other seattle locales the doughnuts are seriously substantial and the coffee is tops ask if they have the applesauce doughnut or the iced toddy odds are they might great place to take kids tons of books to read while eating doughnuts pumpkin oldfashioned in autumn cant go wrong with obamas favorite top pot doughnut its a given the doughnuts are good but what a sweet surprisethe espresso was excellent it tasted like rich cocoa they now have ice cream based off the yummy donut flavors comfortable atmosphere i am a firm believer in the power of the pershing doughnut the maplecovered chocolate cake donut is delish if youre having trouble deciding what to get not the best place to come to work on your computer the wifi  access is spotty at best the bests of the city chocolate glazed old fashion is awesome plenty of young mothers here in the morningsif you are into that sorta thing popular for a good reason had to get an old fashioned pumpkin
